> **Extra Rules**
1. If your username can't be easily mentioned, please set your nickname to something mentionable. For example, "ᐃᑦᑎᓂᖅᓯᐅᑐᖅ ᑕᖅᓴᖅ" isn't particularly useful.
2. This discord allows you to use the workshop channels to go live and share your server development with the community. Be careful what you share however as some may use this as an opportunity to copy what you've made. Ideally you should only go live with your Minecraft window itself.
