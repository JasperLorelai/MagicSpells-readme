# **Welcome to the official MagicSpells Discord!**

To gain access to the rest of the server, you must read and accept the rules below. Run the `~acceptrules` command to accept them.

**NOTE:** These rules are built on top of **Discord's TOS** (<https://dis.gd/terms>) and **Community Guidelines** (<https://dis.gd/guidelines>).

## **General rules (Global)**
1. Discrimination against other members for any reason will not be tolerated and will be punished heavily.
2. Mic/Chat spam is not allowed. Repeated offences will result in removal from the server.
3. Whatever staff says, goes. To an extent.
4. Posing as an administrator is unacceptable. If you do this you will be removed from the server immediately.
5. If you cause loud or annoying background noises you will be removed from the chat.
6. If you're looking for help, please be patient and don't spam the chat until you get an answer. We'll respond as fast as possible.
7. Posting NSFW content will result in quick and harsh punishment.
8. Remember, this community is meant to be a place for people to create amazing stuff and help others. We don't need any arguments here.
9. Unless you are requested to move to direct messaging, you should not DM other members.
10. Asking how to replicate another server's spells is unacceptable. We will never help plagiarism.

## **Support rules (Support channel-specific)**
1. Only use the support channel for MagicSpells-related issues.
2. Posting a config saying "help" can result in an instant support ban.
3. Asking for support in any other category will result in a warning.
4. Use `~supportreq` if you do not know whether the support channel or the learning channel is required for your question.
5. Please do not respond in the support channels if you aren't 100% sure of what you're talking about. While mistakes are fine, we don't want to confuse newer users.

## **Extra Rules**
1. This Discord allows you to use the workshop channels to go live and share your server development with the community. Be careful what you share however as some may use this as an opportunity to copy what you've made. It would be best if you only went Live with your Minecraft window itself.
2. **Do not exchange personal information throughout Discord.** Obviously you're allowed to show your email and such contact details, but please do not post links to Snapchat/Instagram/Facebook or anything of the like. Do not post personal pictures either, especially when it's not in context. There are various privacy and security reasons not to do this, such as identity theft, cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and unfortunately more.

If you are new, commands should be run in <#1008811826810724402> so that you can get access to support channels. **Please FULLY read this channel.**
