## Classical MagicSpells ⭐

This plugin was originally created by [Nisovin], and published on [Bukkit]. After some time TheComputerGeek2 took over the project and published it on [Spigot]. Since then, we dropped support for Spigot and moved to [PaperMC], and the plugin was published on [Modrinth] and [Hangar].
